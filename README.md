# Predicting-Probability-Factor-of-nCOVID-19-with-Severity-Index
In this Project we have calculated the probability of a person being Covid-19 positive with the information like: symptoms, travel history and his locality. We also give a severity index for the patient which is an indication of the severity of his or her disease.
